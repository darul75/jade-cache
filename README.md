# jade-cache 

**jade-cache** purpose is help you to deal with jade view into your code, made for ExpressJs I do not know about others.

* `cache` : compile all jade views at startup into templates in one shot and recursive.
* `middleware` specific route catcher to render these cached templates.

## Why ?

I needed it for emails templating and started by simply compile specific view in code, again and again, but for what ? Why not make it dynamicaly one time for all needed views ?

Then a lot of my "partials" view can be rendered without the need to make a specific route. My "partials" folder has also some sub folders to make it organized and my code was something like:

```javascript
app.get('/partials/:type/:name', function (req, res) {
  var type = req.params.type;
  var name = req.params.name;
  res.render('partials/' + type + '/' + name);
  // calling jade render method then...
}
```

What can be easily done with a small middleware, I will try explain you later how to use it.

And play little bit, see how node core, express, jade are working.

## Install

~~~
npm install jade-cache

## Usage

### Cache

Done by default, all your views are put in cache at application boot.

```javascript
var jcc = require('jcc');

app.configure(function() {
      app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
      app.set('view engine', 'jade');
      ...
});

var options = {};

jcc.init(options, app, function() {
  // all jade are compiled and cached
});

...

// later in your code when you need template
req.app.get('jade-compiled-templates')['/path-to/jade-view']({email:'darul75@gmail.com'});  
// WHERE
// 'email' is your view variable
// 'jade-compiled-templates' is default cache name
```
With debug mode set console output show template `key` to use with cache '/partials/home/example' for instance.

```
- file .DS_Store' is not a jade file, might not be placed here.
- file compiled.jade' has been compiled and put in cache (key) for route:'/partials/compiled'
- file example.jade' has been compiled and put in cache (key) for route:'/partials/home/example'
- file home.jade' has been compiled and put in cache (key) for route:'/partials/home/home'
- file home2.jade' has been compiled and put in cache (key) for route:'/partials/home/home2'
- file subhome.jade' has been compiled and put in cache (key) for route:'/partials/home/subhome/subhome'
- file notjade.txt' is not a jade file, might not be placed here.
- file test.jade' has been compiled and put in cache (key) for route:'/partials/test'
```

### Middleware

Keep it mind this middleware has sense specially for "partials" jade views with no jade "variables" to be processed in view: #{var}

See http://jade-lang.com/api/ for more info.

By default all `/partials/...` route will use this middleware, `/partials/view1.jade', '/partials/folder1/view2'.

But you can add some route or change it in options.

```javascript
var jcc = require('jcc');

app.configure(function() {
      app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
      app.set('view engine', 'jade');
      app.use(jcc.handle);
      ...
});

// NO NEED TO MAKE SPECIFIC ROUTE 
/*
app.get('/partials/folder1/view1', function (req, res) {
  var type = req.params.type;
  var name = req.params.name;
  res.render('partials/' + type + '/' + name);
  calling jade render method then...
}*/

var options = {};

jcc.init(options, app, function() {
  // all is compiled
  app.enable('jcc'); // mandatory for middleware to be activated
});
...

// later in you code can still use this:
 // 'email' is your view variable
req.app.get('jade-compiled-templates')['/path-to/jade-view']({email:'darul75@gmail.com'});
```

## Options

- `debug` : see trace, useful at startup you will see all your routes path and check for errors compiling views, default `false`.
- `exclude` : file or directory to exclude from jade compile processing, default `['.svn', '.DS_Store']`.
- `routes` : routes matching middleware use, keep it mind do not handle jade variables because simply call template with no parameter, default `'/partials'`
- `cache`: cache name, default `'jade-compiled-templates'`
