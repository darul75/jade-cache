# jade-express 

**jade-express** will not change your life but help you to deal with jade view into your code. 
Compatible for ExpressJs I do not know about others.

* `cache` : compile all jade views at startup into templates.
* `middleware` specific route catcher to render these cache templates.

## Why ?

I needed it for emails templating and started by simply compile specific view in code, again and again, but for what ? Why not make it dynamicaly one time for all needed views ?

Then a lot of my "partials" view can be rendered too without the need to make a specific route, mine was

And play little bit, see how node core, express, jade are working.

```javascript
app.get('partials/:id/:name')

// and something like 
function(req, res) {
  res.render('
}

```

So I have choosed a solution with a small middleware. I will try explain you later how to use it.

## Install

~~~
npm install jade-express
~~~

## Usage

### Cache

Done by default, all your views are put in cache at application boot.

```javascript
var jcc = require('jcc');

app.configure(function() {
      app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
      app.set('view engine', 'jade');
      ...
});

var options = {};

jcc.init(options, app, function() {
  // all is compiled
});

...

// later in you code when you need template
req.app.get('jade-compiled-templates')['/path-to/jade-view']({email:'darul75@gmail.com'});  
// WHERE
// 'email' is your view variable
// 'jade-compiled-templates' is default cache name
```

### Middleware

Keep it mind this middleware has sense specially for "partials" template use, with no jade "variables" to be processed in view. %{var}

```javascript
var jcc = require('jcc');

app.configure(function() {
      app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
      app.set('view engine', 'jade');
      app.use(jcc.handle);
      ...
});

var options = {};

jcc.init(options, app, function() {
  // all is compiled
  app.enable('jcc'); // mandatory for middleware to be activated
});
...

// later in you code can still use this:
 // 'email' is your view variable
req.app.get('jade-compiled-templates')['/path-to/jade-view']({email:'darul75@gmail.com'});
```

## Options

- `debug` : see trace, useful at startup you will see all your routes path and check for errors compiling views, default `false`.
- `exclude` : file or directory to exclude from jade compile processing, default `['.svn', '.DS_Store']`.
- `routes` : routes matching middleware use, keep it mind do not handle jade variables because simply call template with no parameter, default `'partials'`
- `cache`: cache name, default `'jade-compiled-templates'`
